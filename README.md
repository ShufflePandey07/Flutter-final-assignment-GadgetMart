## API Integration

The Flutter app communicates with the backend via a RESTful API, handling operations such as product management, order processing, and user data handling.

## Future Works

## Challenges

- **State Management**: Managing complex state across various components, particularly with features like virtual try-on, user authentication, and shopping cart, was handled using Riverpod and clean architecture principles.
- **AR Integration**: Integrating augmented reality for the virtual try-on feature in a mobile environment required overcoming challenges related to performance, accurate rendering, and compatibility with different devices.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that the user interface remained consistent and functional across a wide range of devices and screen sizes was achieved through Flutterâ€™s responsive layout features.
- **API Integration**: Handling API requests for real-time product updates, user authentication, and AR data processing while maintaining smooth and secure communication was crucial and required thorough testing.
